Fortunately, there are some ways to download Anime Slam Dunk 720p for free. In this article, we will show you how to do it safely and legally. Here are the steps:
 
1. Find a torrent site that has Slam Dunk in 720p. One of the best options is Anime Tosho[^1^], which has a complete collection of Slam Dunk episodes and movies in BD 720p x264 10bit AAC format. This means that the video quality is very good and the file size is relatively small.
2. Download a torrent client that can handle magnet links. A magnet link is a type of URL that allows you to download files directly from other users without having to download a torrent file first. Some of the most popular torrent clients are uTorrent, BitTorrent, qBittorrent, and Vuze.
3. Copy the magnet link of the Slam Dunk torrent you want to download from Anime Tosho. You can find it under the Source Links section of each episode or movie. For example, this is the magnet link for the first episode: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:0a8f9c7b4a9f2c0a2f8c8d5d7e3b6e0b2f9a8c4b&dn=%5BSanKyuu%5D+Slam+Dunk+-+01+%28BD+720p+Hi10P+AAC%29+%5BEAFEFC0F%5D.mkv&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fnyaa.tracker.wf%3A7777%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.stealth.si%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969`
4. Paste the magnet link into your torrent client and start downloading. Depending on your internet speed and the number of seeders (users who have the complete file and are sharing it), it might take some time to finish downloading.
